User Guide
==========

Please be patient as our documentation expert (a.k.a our lead developer)
is busy making the software not suck so he's had some trouble finding
time to update these guides. If you would like to contribute to this
User Guide, please refer to the :ref:`Contributing <contributing>` section of the Developer
Guide.

If you would prefer to submit documentation updates as Word docs or
collaborate with us using Google Docs, please share the docs or links
with our Support Team `support@openboxes.com <support@openboxes.com>`__.

If you're impatient, not good at words & stuff, and/or would prefer to see
User Guide completed pronto, please feel free to light a fire under our
documentation expert. The most effective way to do that would be to
shame him through any of the public support channels (i.e. Twitter,
Slack, Google Groups, highway billboards, etc).
