Tagging a release
=================

Find the current build number in the footer of the page for the desired version of the application:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

    Build Number: v0.5.0-329-gc1b3544 

In this case, the tag v0.5.0 is out-of-date, so we want to update this
to v0.5.1. We first need to find the commit related to this build number
(e.g. ``c1b3544``). You can view the commit log to view the history or
you might need to browse through old commits on github to double check
that it's correct.

::

    $ git log --pretty=oneline | grep c1b3544

Create tag release
------------------

Once you've determined that this is the correct commit and you're ready
to create a new tag, run the following command:

::

    $ git tag -a v0.5.1 -m 'Release 0.5.1' c1b3544

Push tags to git remote repo
----------------------------

Then you can push this (and all other tags) to your repository to share:

::

    $ git push --tags
