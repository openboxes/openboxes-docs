Contributing
============

There are many ways to contribute to OpenBoxes, and not just through
making changes to the source code. Here are a few examples of areas we
need a considerable amount of help.

-  Develop a new feature
-  Patch a bug / hotfix
-  Improve translations
-  Improve documentation
-  Write unit, integration, functional tests

Resources
---------

-  `GitHub Guide on
   Forking <https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/>`__

Procedure
---------

1. Find or create an issue for the feature or bug in `GitHub
   Issues. <https://github.com/openboxes/openboxes/issues>`__

2. Fork the
   `openboxes/openboxes <https://github.com/openboxes/openboxes>`__
   GitHub repository. |Fork Repo|

3. Create a branch for your changes (create a ``hotfix`` for bugs if
   working off ``master`` or a ``feature`` branch for features if
   working off ``develop``). **NOTE:** The use of the ``hotfix`` or
   ``develop`` prefix will help us identify which branch we need to
   merge your changes into.

   ::

       git checkout -b hotfix/123-short-summary-of-issue
       git checkout -b feature/123-short-summary-of-issue

4. Implement your feature or hotfix in your new branch.

5. Write a test for your changes (if you have trouble with this step
   please comment in your ticket that you'd like some help). **NOTE:**
   Tests are required for features and bug fixes, but not for
   documentation and translation changes.

6. Run tests.

   ::

       grails test-app unit:
       grails test-app integration:

7. Commit your changes

   ::

       git commit -m "Implemented feature #123"
