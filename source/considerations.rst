Considerations
==============

While open-source software is free to download and use, there are costs
and limitations that should be taken into consideration before you begin
the adoption process.

System Administration
---------------------

An OpenBoxes installation requires a system administrator to install,
monitor, maintain, and upgrade the software and server components
throughout the software lifecycle. These tasks require competent IT
personnel.

Time
----

While OpenBoxes has been streamlined considerably since its creation,
there may be significant time costs associated with using this inventory
management system.

Examples of potentially time-intensive tasks include, but are not
limited to:

-  Master Data Management e.g. creating products to track within the
   system
-  Periodic Reviews e.g. stock counts, min/max/reorder review, fast
   moving vs. obsolete inventory
-  Data Entry e.g. recording and adjusting inventory
-  Forecasting e.g. period review of demand/consumption data, disease
   incidence, population growth, service expansion within the hospital

Training
--------

While OpenBoxes is a relatively simple inventory management tool, some
training is required to allow users to successfully utilize all of the
functionality offered by the system.

Hospital-Centric
----------------

While OpenBoxes could be used by small-to-medium-sized enterprises (SME)
in most industries, there are some limitations that might make it
difficult to use:

1) OpenBoxes does not have a Sales Order feature yet. There's not an
   overwhleming need for such a feature within the hospital. For now,
   you can create a new location to represent a customer, generate a PO
   for that location (customer) against your facility depot, and fulfill
   that PO in order to approximate a Sales Order. This feature will
   eventually be implemented as pharmacists would like to generate a
   sales order when filling a prescription for a patient.

2) The Requisition feature (i.e. Pull Replenishment) which is used to
   move stock from a facility depot to a point-of-service location (e.g.
   ward, pharmacy) is primarily used within the depot. In other words,
   Requisitions are created by a warehouse manager within the hospital
   depot instead of by the requesting party (i.e. a nurse or
   pharmacist).

This was a decision made in order to save time and avoid the need for
adding time-intensive processes for nurses and pharmacists. In the use
case at Mirebalis Hospital, nurses and pharmacists will send a paper
requisitions to the hospital depot, warehouse staff will enter the
requisition into the system and proceed to fulfill that requisition.
OpenBoxes will eventually have a point-of-service (POS) client for
nurses and pharmacists to request stock from the depot, but that feature
is not currently in development.

Static Role-based Authorization
-------------------------------

The OpenBoxes authorization mechanism currently only provides three
roles (Admin, Manager, and Browser). This limits the ability for an
administrator to create roles based on fine-grained permissions. For
example, all Manager users have the ability to perform CRUD actions
(create, retrieve, update, delete) on most objects within the system.
However, I cannot create a new role (e.g. Shift Manager) that allows a
user to create a Product, but not a Purchase Order. A more fine-grained
approach will be implemented in a future version of OpenBoxes.
