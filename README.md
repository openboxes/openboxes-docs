Public documentation for the OpenBoxes application.

<br>

## Contributor Guide
Documentation containing instructions, standards, and background information for technical and non-technical contributors to the OpenBoxes community.

Live at: https://openboxes.gitbook.io/contributor-guide/

Built using [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/). Synchronized with the files in the [./contributor-guide](https://github.com/openboxes/openboxes-docs/tree/main/contributor-guide) folder.

If you'd like to add to or modify the documentation in this guide, please create a new branch or [fork the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) and directly modify the relevant markdown (.md) files there. Then [make a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) from your branch into the `main` branch of this repository. We'll try to review your change promptly.

If you're a regular contributor to our documentation, you can request to be added to the OpenBoxes GitBook project where you'll be able to edit the documentation using the GitBook GUI, which is more user-friendly than editing markdown files. For access, please send an email to support@openboxes.com.
