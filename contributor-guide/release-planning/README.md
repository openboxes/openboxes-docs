# Suggesting New Features

The bulk of the feature development in the core openboxes repository is driven internally by Partners In Health (PIH). This is why you'll often see pull requests referencing tickets from a PIH-only Jira board.

That said, we're striving to be more transparent and community-oriented with our development, and are looking to shift towards using [GitHub issues](https://github.com/openboxes/openboxes/issues) more broadly.



If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in OpenBoxes, you are probably not alone. Many of the OpenBoxes features exist because our users voiced a need for them.

We encourage you to [start a new discussion topic](https://github.com/openboxes/openboxes/discussions/categories/ideas) on our GitHub page that outlines the feature that you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.
