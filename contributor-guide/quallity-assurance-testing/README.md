# Reporting Bugs

Even if you don't have the capacity to provide a fix yourself, reporting bugs is a useful way to help us improve the stability of the app.

If you've found a bug in OpenBoxes, take a look through the [existing reported issues](https://github.com/openboxes/openboxes/issues) to see if the bug has already been reported, and if not, please [open a new GitHub issue](https://github.com/openboxes/openboxes/issues/new).

When creating the bug report, make sure to provide enough context so that the team can properly investigate the issue. At a minimum, please include the following information:

1. The version of OpenBoxes that you're using. You can find the version at the bottom of the webpage.
2. The operating system and browser that you're using.
3. The steps that you performed to produce the bug.
4. What you expected to see.
5. What you saw instead.
6. Screenshots and videos are extremely helpful! Please include some if possible.
