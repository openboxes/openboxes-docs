# Adding new languages

If the language you're trying to translate is not yet in OpenBoxes or Crowdin, the following instructions outline how to get the language added.

## Requesting a new language

If you're not a project administrator, get in contact with us by posting to the [OpenBoxes Slack](http://slack-signup.openboxes.com/), [adding a post to our community forums](https://community.openboxes.com/), or by [creating a new GitHub Issue](https://github.com/openboxes/openboxes/issues). Let us know the language that you'd like to translate and we'll get you set up as quickly as possible.
