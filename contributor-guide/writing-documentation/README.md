# Editing This Guide

This guide is built using [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/) and is synchronized with the files in the [./contributor-guide](https://github.com/openboxes/openboxes-docs/tree/main/contributor-guide) folder.

If you'd like to add to or modify the documentation in this guide, please do the following:

* [Create a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) of the [openboxes-docs](https://github.com/openboxes/openboxes-docs) repository
* Directly modify the relevant markdown (.md) files in a branch in your fork
* [Make a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) from your branch into the `main` branch of the openboxes-docs repository.

We'll try to review your change promptly.

If you're a regular contributor to our documentation, you can request to be added to the OpenBoxes GitBook project where you'll be able to edit the documentation using the GitBook GUI, which can be more user-friendly than directly editing markdown files. For access to the GitBook, please send an email to [support@openboxes.com](mailto:support@openboxes.com).
